> [!CAUTION]
> **Early Development Notice**
> 
> Focust is currently in active early development and rapid iteration. This is my first Rust project, and I'm learning as I build. You may encounter bugs, incomplete features, or breaking changes. Your patience, feedback, and contributions are greatly appreciated! 🙏
>
> **Platform Support**: While Focust is designed to be cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux), it has currently only been tested on **Windows**. If you're on macOS or Linux, please try it out and report any issues you encounter. Platform-specific contributions are especially welcome!

## 📋 Quick Start

See the [QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for a step-by-step guide to getting started with Focust.

## ✨ Features

### 🕐 Smart Break Scheduling

- **Flexible Break Types**: Configure mini breaks (short 20s pauses) and long breaks (5-minute rest periods)
- **Customizable Intervals**: Set your own break frequency — mini breaks every 20 minutes, long breaks after 4 mini breaks
- **Time-Based Schedules**: Create different schedules for work hours, restrict breaks to weekdays, or set custom time ranges
- **Intelligent Detection**: Automatically pauses breaks when you're away from your computer
- **Postpone Support**: Need 5 more minutes? Postpone breaks with a global hotkey or button click

![Break Schedule Settings](docs/images/screenshot-break-schedules.png)
*Configure multiple break schedules with custom time ranges and active days*

### 🎨 Beautiful & Customizable Themes

- **Rich Backgrounds**: Choose from solid colors, single images, or random images from a folder
- **Full Customization**: Adjust text color, blur effects, opacity, font size, and font family
- **Visual Feedback**: See your break window in full glory with customizable size (50%-100% or fullscreen)
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Show break reminders on all monitors simultaneously

![Break Window](docs/images/screenshot-break-window.png)
*Immersive break window with customizable themes and suggestions*

### 🔔 Timed Reminders (Attention System)

- **Alarm-Style Reminders**: Set specific times to remind yourself of important tasks
- **Non-Intrusive**: Unlike break reminders, these don't block your work — just gentle notifications and can be dismissed immediately
- **Multiple Times**: Add as many reminder times as you need throughout the day
- **Perfect For**: Drinking water, taking medication, standing up, or any time-sensitive task

![Timed Reminders](docs/images/screenshot-attentions.png)
*Set up timed reminders for healthy habits*

### 💡 Break Suggestions

- **Motivational Messages**: Get helpful suggestions during breaks (stretch exercises, eye exercises, hydration reminders)
- **Multi-Language Support**: Built-in suggestions in English, Chinese and other 8 common languages, with easy customization
- **TOML-Based Configuration**: Add your own custom suggestion lists
- **Random Selection**: Fresh suggestions every break to keep things interesting

![Suggestions Settings](docs/images/screenshot-suggestions.png)
*Customize break suggestions or use built-in curated lists*

### 🔊 Audio Notifications

- **Built-in Sounds**: Choose from 4 carefully selected notification sounds
  - Gentle Bell
  - Soft Gong
  - Bright Notification
  - Simple Notification
- **Custom Audio**: Use your own MP3, WAV, OGG, or FLAC files
- **Volume Control**: Adjust audio volume to your preference
- **Preview**: Test sounds before saving
- **Dual Playback**: Audio plays when breaks start AND when they naturally end to help you stay aware of transitions

### ⚙️ Advanced Features

- **System Tray Integration**: Minimize to tray, quick pause/resume, status indicators
- **Global Hotkeys**: Postpone breaks without switching windows
- **Strict Mode**: Force breaks when you really need them (cannot be skipped)
- **Break Notifications**: Get notified before breaks start (configurable lead time)
- **Automatic Pausing**: Detects system idle time and pauses the scheduler
- **DND Detection**: Automatically pauses breaks when Do Not Disturb/Focus Assist is enabled (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Application Exclusions**: Pause or resume scheduler based on active applications (e.g., pause during presentations, resume when coding)
- **Theme Modes**: Light, dark, or system-based theme for settings UI
- **Detailed Logging**: Debug logs for troubleshooting

![General Settings](docs/images/screenshot-general.png)
*General settings with language, theme, and behavior options*

![App Exclusions](docs/images/screenshot-appexclusions.png)
*Automatically pause or resume break scheduler based on active applications*

### 🌍 Internationalization

- Currently supported: English (en-US), Simplified Chinese (zh-CN), Japanese (ja-JP), German (de-DE), French (fr-FR), Spanish (es-ES), Russian (ru-RU), Portuguese (pt-BR), Italian (it-IT), Korean (ko-KR)
- Automatic language detection based on system locale
- Easy to add new languages (contributions welcome!)

### ⚡ Performance & Efficiency

Built with performance in mind, Focust offers exceptional resource efficiency:

- **Ultra-Low Memory Footprint**: Uses only ~10MB when running in the background, thanks to dynamic window creation and lazy-loaded Vue components
- **Native Performance**: Powered by Tauri's lightweight WebView instead of bundled Chromium
- **Fast Startup**: Cold start in under 2 seconds
- **Minimal CPU Usage**: <1% CPU when idle, <5% during break windows
- **Small Binary Size**: Significantly smaller than Electron-based alternatives

*Perfect for users who want break reminders without sacrificing system resources.*
