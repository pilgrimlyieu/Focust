## üìã Quick Start

See the [QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for a step-by-step guide to getting started with Focust.

## ‚ú® Features

### üïê Smart Break Scheduling

- **Flexible Break Types**: Configure mini breaks (short 20s pauses) and long breaks (5-minute rest periods)
- **Customizable Intervals**: Set your own break frequency ‚Äî mini breaks every 20 minutes, long breaks after 4 mini breaks
- **Time-Based Schedules**: Create different schedules for work hours, restrict breaks to weekdays, or set custom time ranges
- **Intelligent Detection**: Automatically pauses breaks when you're away from your computer
- **Postpone Support**: Need 5 more minutes? Postpone breaks with a global hotkey or button click

![Break Schedule Settings](docs/images/screenshot-schedules.png)
*Configure multiple break schedules with custom time ranges and active days*

- **Visual Feedback**: See your break window in full glory with customizable size (50%-100% or fullscreen)
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Show break reminders on all monitors simultaneously

<!-- ![Break Window](docs/images/screenshot-break-window.png) -->
![Break Window](https://pilgrimlyieu.github.io/daily/2025-10/29_focust.jpg)
*Immersive break window with customizable themes and suggestions*

### üîî Timed Reminders (Attention System)

- **Alarm-Style Reminders**: Set specific times to remind yourself of important tasks
- **Non-Intrusive**: Unlike break reminders, these don't block your work ‚Äî just gentle notifications
- **Multiple Times**: Add as many reminder times as you need throughout the day
- **Perfect For**: Drinking water, taking medication, standing up, or any time-sensitive task

![Timed Reminders](docs/images/screenshot-attentions.png)
*Set up timed reminders for healthy habits*

### üí° Break Suggestions

- **Multi-Language Support**: Built-in suggestions in English and Chinese, with easy customization
- **TOML-Based Configuration**: Add your own custom suggestion lists

- **Global Hotkeys**: Postpone breaks without switching windows
- **Strict Mode**: Force breaks when you really need them (cannot be skipped)
- **Break Notifications**: Get notified before breaks start (configurable lead time)
- **Automatic Pausing**(TODO): Detects system idle time and pauses the scheduler
- **DND Detection**(TODO): Planned feature to detect Do Not Disturb mode
- **Theme Modes**: Light, dark, or system-based theme for settings UI
- **Detailed Logging**: Debug logs for troubleshooting

![General Settings](docs/images/screenshot-general.png)
*General settings with language, theme, and behavior options*

### üåç Internationalization

- Currently supported: English (en-US), Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)
- Automatic language detection based on system locale
- Easy to add new languages (contributions welcome!)

### ‚ö° Performance & Efficiency

Built with performance in mind, Focust offers exceptional resource efficiency:

- **Ultra-Low Memory Footprint**: Uses only ~5MB when running in the background, thanks to dynamic window creation and lazy-loaded Vue components
- **Native Performance**: Powered by Tauri's lightweight WebView instead of bundled Chromium
- **Fast Startup**: Cold start in under 2 seconds
- **Minimal CPU Usage**: <1% CPU when idle, <5% during break windows
- **Small Binary Size**: Significantly smaller than Electron-based alternatives

*Perfect for users who want break reminders without sacrificing system resources.*
